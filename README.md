Procedure for Kahoot clone showcases

- Everyone joins in and answers the questions
- We have fun

### Questions regarding Kahoot clone showcases:

**Q: Do we have to talk about the project / show code / etc?**

A: No, you don't have to say or show anything (or even stand in front of the class - I can just distribute your application link, so we can play)

**Q: Our clone is not functional / not deployed / etc**

A: No worries - you may also show your UI / present a game round locally if you would like to
